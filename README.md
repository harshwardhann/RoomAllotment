# RoomAllotment
An algorithm that dynamically adjusts the prices of rooms according to their demand to reach market clearing prices for different rooms in the same apartment
My friends and I had trouble alloting rooms in the apartment as corner rooms were everybody's choice. We eventually ended up having an auction for all rooms. I later decided to automate the process and thus ended up creating this algorithm.

To use this script, run it with two arguments: the number of rooms and the starting rent; it will prompt you for the next step.
